# Roman Calendar (RomanDateTime)
An implementation of the Roman calendar system. The calendar system used is post-Julian reforms (46 BC) however it represents dates in the [proleptic Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Gregorian_calendar) for ease of conversion for now. It represents all the systems and quirks the calendar had, and is as accurate as I could make it from my research.
If there are any features or issues with current systems feel free to raise issues if they are not already mentioned here!
